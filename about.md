Welcome on my coding blog.

## This blog?

You shall not find here anything but coding tips, snippets and small sample projects.

As most of my daily works are using Java and web technologies I might post a bit about
JavaScript and jQuery.

But my heart belongs to NeXTStep, so I will certainly post about Objective-C and Cocoa
on OS X and iOS. As new hotness is on the Swift I will also post about experiments.


## Me?

I'm a developper. I love coding on Mac and iOS on my spare time. 
I wrote a book, now out of print, [about Objective-C 2](http://www.macg.co/2010/12/un-précis-et-concis-consacré-à-objective-c-20-9455). 

I also published another one about [OS X Automator tool](http://Automatisez.net/). 

More on the web?
