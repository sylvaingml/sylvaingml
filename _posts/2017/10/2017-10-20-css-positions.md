- "relative" indicate that element position is _relative to itself_. Also used as reference container for elements in _absolute_.
- "absolute" forces position inside a container that is the first parent in relative positin, or the html element. 
- "fixed" means to position element in absolute position relative to browser view (the area displaying the page content).
