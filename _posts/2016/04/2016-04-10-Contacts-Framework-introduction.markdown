I've uploaded a simple playground [available here][gitProject] as an introduction
to the new *Contacts* framework for iOS and OS X.

This playground is pretty simple and self documented.

I will details how to access the contact data store and fetch contacts data
using simple query or by browsing through the whole addressbook.
