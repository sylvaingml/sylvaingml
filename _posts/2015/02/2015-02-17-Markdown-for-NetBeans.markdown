I tend to use more and more NetBeans as my cross-platform editor of choice.

Mostly because it shines for web development and has a pretty good support for Git.

Just one thing was lacking: the support for Markdown syntax when editing files.

This plugin is [available on Github](https://github.com/madflow/flow-netbeans-markdown)
and can be installed directly. Just get the *nbm* distribution.

In settings, you can enable some extensions to standard markdown, such as tables
or Wikilinks.

I'm testing it, but it seems pretty good for now.

Give it a try.
