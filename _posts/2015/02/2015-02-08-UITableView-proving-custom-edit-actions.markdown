This repository is a sample project to show how you can customize a `UITableView`
to be able to provide a custom set of action.

This example is relying on standard API and do not make use of any custom handling
of swipe gesture. 

In this sample project, actions are visible when swiping from right to left, 
and this show a simple mean to replace the standard _delete_ action.

Sample project is availabile [here](https://github.com/sylvaingml/ex-UIKit-UITableView-CustomRowActions)
